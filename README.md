# RESTful_API_SpringBoot_DEV
This project is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot that allows users to execute system commands remotely and retrieve the results. It includes features such as authentication, database storage for command history, logging, monitoring, and cross-platform support for executing commands.

# Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
## Install Required Tools
  - Java Development Kit (JDK 17+)
  - Maven (Dependency Management)
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL (Database)
  - Lombok (For Reducing Boilerplate Code)
  - Docker (Optional, for Containerization)
## Generate the Spring Boot Project
  - Use Spring Initializr to create a new project.
## Add dependencies
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Boot Actuator
  - Lombok
  - DevTools
- Set Up the Project Structure
  - Organize the project into logical packages

# Step 2: Define the Application Requirements
The application should:
1. Provide RESTful APIs for:
    - Executing system commands.
    - Retrieving the history of executed commands.
2. Secure the APIs using basic authentication.
3. Store command execution details in a database.
4. Include logging and monitoring capabilities.
